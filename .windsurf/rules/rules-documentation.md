# Rules — Documentation (Docs-as-Code)

- Keep PRD/SPEC/ADR under docs/ with templates. Update docs with code changes.
- Use short, task-focused READMEs; link to runbooks and designs.
- Keep a Changelog via versions/ when releases apply. Prefer diagrams-as-code where possible.
- Lint docs (markdownlint, cspell). Keep examples minimal and runnable.

References: Keep a Changelog; repo templates.
