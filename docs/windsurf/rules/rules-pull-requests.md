# Rules — Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and coherent. Link PRD/SPEC/ADRs. State scope, risks, and test impact.
- Ensure CI green; include tests for acceptance criteria; describe telemetry/flags/rollback.
- Provide reviewer guidance: areas changed, how to validate, follow-ups.
- Avoid noisy diffs (formatting-only) unless isolated.
