# Rules — Code Review

- Goal: maintain quality and boundaries; improve design; share context.
- Review for: correctness, tests, architecture boundaries, telemetry, security, docs.
- Prefer facts/data over opinion. If multiple valid approaches, accept author choice.
- Keep comments actionable: Blocker / Suggestion / Nit. Group related notes.
- Small, focused PRs are easier to review; ask for split when needed.
